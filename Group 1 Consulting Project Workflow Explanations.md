1 front desk staff member

Time: (1 min)

VA: Save 4 min per patient, give desk staff more time to schedule faster

Competencies: Familiarity with computer software

Expenditures: Patient portal for $15,000

Rationale for Check-in: Adding a second point of entry allows front desk staff members to check-in more

patients, for those who decide to check-in in-person. Only one desk staff member will need to check the

online portal to ensure that patients have arrived, and they will multitask by also checking-in in-person

patients. They will then pass on the message to Medical Assistants to begin the vitals process. We are

accounting for patients who are not comfortable with checking in online as well as patients who forget to

do this step before arriving at the practice.

Care Path 3: Physical exams & general wellness / prevention

•

•

•

•

Staff Resources: PCPs and RN

Lead Time: 25–30 min

Each physician will have an extra 12.5 hours of capacity to allocate

VA: patients can have more time with PCP

Competencies: Phlebotomy, immunology, Physician and RN level clinical skills

Rationale for Assessment & Fulfillment: It is necessary to hire a Physician’s Assistant because they will

reduce physician patient panel size per doctor by 375 patients, resulting in a final patient panel per

physician of 1,125. That means that 50% of the low acuity patients (3,000 since 50% of 6,000) will be

offloaded onto PA, and 1500 patients will align with PA capacity since they are low-acuity patients. The

physicians will then have more time to focus on more complex patients and increase patient satisfaction.

Each physician will have an extra 62.5 hours of capacity to allocate. Half of these hours will be allocated

towards both complex chronic disease management (18.75 hours, 30%) and physical exams & general

wellness (12.5 hours, 20%) as well as administrative oversight of the PA.

Staff Resources: 1 billing clerk

Lead Time: 5 min

NVA but necessary

Competencies: Billing software, customer service

Rationale for Checkout: If patients require billing assistance, scheduling for any following visits, and/or

any last-minute questions, checkout will be necessary. Otherwise, patients will not need to stop at

checkout as they leave post-appointment.

**The changes that we’ve made will in total cost $135,000**

**Conclusion:**

This ideal value state map currently prioritizes the customer’s value proposition. We provided a

recommendation for a more seamless check-in process. We also recommend hiring an additional staff

member, a Physician’s Assistant, to reduce the number of low-level basic acute care patients on each

physician’s patient panel by 375 patients. This will allow the doctors to focus more on complex disease

management and physical exams & general wellness visits. While there is additional PA administrative

oversight required on the part of the physician, half of the extra hours the physicians will gain from hiring

a PA will be allocated to this administrative work.
