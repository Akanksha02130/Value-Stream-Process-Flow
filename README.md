# Value-Stream-Process-Flow

Problem Statement:
-

- The healthcare facility is facing operational inefficiencies and customer satisfaction challenges due to its current check-in, assessment & fulfillment, and checkout processes. These processes need improvement to enhance patient experience and optimize resource utilization. Additionally, the organization is considering hiring a Physician's Assistant to address workload distribution among healthcare providers.

Check-In Process:
-
- Problem: The current in-person check-in process involves two front desk staff members and takes 5 minutes, resulting in inefficient resource utilization.
- Problem: Online check-in requires one front desk staff member and an expenditure of $15,000 for a patient portal.
- Problem: Patients who prefer in-person check-in or forget to check in online cause delays and reduce the overall efficiency of the check-in process.
- Objective: Streamline the check-in process to reduce resource utilization and ensure a seamless experience for both in-person and online check-ins.

  
Assessment & Fulfillment Process:
-
- Problem: The current process lacks a dedicated Physician's Assistant (PA) for handling low-level basic acute care patients, causing inefficiencies.
- Problem: Complex chronic disease management and general wellness visits are time-consuming for physicians, reducing their capacity for patient care.
- Problem: The organization needs to allocate resources effectively to improve patient satisfaction and maximize physician capacity.
- Objective: Optimize resource allocation by hiring a PA, offloading low-acuity patients, and allowing physicians to focus on complex cases, ultimately enhancing patient care.
  
Checkout Process:
-
- Problem: The checkout process, while necessary for billing and addressing patient queries, is not streamlined and may result in delays.
- Objective: Improve the efficiency of the checkout process to minimize delays and ensure a smooth departure for patients.

Proposed Solution:
