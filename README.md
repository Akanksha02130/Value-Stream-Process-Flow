# Value-Stream-Process-Flow

Problem Statement:
-

- The healthcare facility is facing operational inefficiencies and customer satisfaction challenges due to its current check-in, assessment & fulfillment, and checkout processes. These processes need improvement to enhance patient experience and optimize resource utilization. Additionally, the organization is considering hiring a Physician's Assistant to address workload distribution among healthcare providers.

Check-In Process:
-
- Problem: The current in-person check-in process involves two front desk staff members and takes 5 minutes, resulting in inefficient resource utilization.
- Problem: Online check-in requires one front desk staff member and an expenditure of $15,000 for a patient portal.
- Problem: Patients who prefer in-person check-in or forget to check in online cause delays and reduce the overall efficiency of the check-in process.
- Objective: Streamline the check-in process to reduce resource utilization and ensure a seamless experience for both in-person and online check-ins.

  
Assessment & Fulfillment Process:
-
- Problem: The current process lacks a dedicated Physician's Assistant (PA) for handling low-level basic acute care patients, causing inefficiencies.
- Problem: Complex chronic disease management and general wellness visits are time-consuming for physicians, reducing their capacity for patient care.
- Problem: The organization needs to allocate resources effectively to improve patient satisfaction and maximize physician capacity.
- Objective: Optimize resource allocation by hiring a PA, offloading low-acuity patients, and allowing physicians to focus on complex cases, ultimately enhancing patient care.
  
Checkout Process:
-
- Problem: The checkout process, while necessary for billing and addressing patient queries, is not streamlined and may result in delays.
- Objective: Improve the efficiency of the checkout process to minimize delays and ensure a smooth departure for patients.


Proposed Solution Summary:
-

### Check-In Process:

#### Problem 1: Inefficient in-person check-in process.
**Solution:** Implemented an entry point system with 2 receptionists, optimizing resource utilization and reducing check-in time.

#### Problem 2: Costly online check-in process.
**Solution:** Encouraged patients to check in online, saving 4 minutes per patient and avoiding the need for an expensive patient portal.

#### Problem 3: Delays from in-person check-ins.
**Solution:** Maintained online check-in option and designed the entry point system to seamlessly handle both in-person and online check-ins.

### Assessment & Fulfillment Process:

#### Problem 1: Lack of a dedicated PA for low-level basic acute care.
**Solution:** Introduced a dedicated PA, supported by MAs and PCPs, streamlining services for low-acuity patients.

#### Problem 2: Time-consuming complex disease management.
**Solution:** Allocated specific resources (PCPs, RN) for complex cases, optimizing resource utilization and improving patient care.

#### Problem 3: Ineffective resource allocation.
**Solution:** Introduced a PA for low-acuity patients, improving patient satisfaction and maximizing physician capacity.

### Checkout Process:

#### Problem: Non-streamlined checkout process.
**Solution:** Introduced a dedicated billing clerk with competencies in billing software and customer service, streamlining the checkout process.

### Lean Six Sigma Integration:

#### Define Phase:
Clearly outlined the inefficiencies in the check-in, assessment & fulfillment, and checkout processes, identifying areas for improvement.

#### Measure Phase:
Quantified the time and resource utilization inefficiencies in each process, establishing baseline metrics for improvement.

#### Analyze Phase:
Identified key problems such as in-person check-in inefficiencies and time-consuming disease management, analyzing root causes for targeted solutions.

#### Improve Phase:
Implemented Lean principles by introducing an entry point system, optimizing resource allocation, and streamlining the checkout process.

#### Control Phase:
Established ongoing monitoring and feedback mechanisms to ensure the sustained success of the proposed solutions, aligning with the principles of Lean Six Sigma.

By applying Lean Six Sigma principles, the proposed solutions not only addressed specific problems but also ensured a continuous improvement approach to maintain efficiency gains over time. This integrated approach reflects a commitment to quality, efficiency, and patient satisfaction in the healthcare facility.
